  - Responsive design allows for ease of usage from both desktop and mobile access.

  - Integrate a login feature to be able to create and save personal performances to later listen to or share.

## Personal Insight
> The React Drum Kit is a personal achievement of mine because I've always wanted to be in a band, and was able to create an application that allows anyone to be a one-man-band!

> After fully implementing all features, I made a few changes to make the user experience smoother.
